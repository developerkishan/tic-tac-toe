Listening to Philip Col 
The coding project that improved my skill the most - 

There are mostly all the application which needs authentication , Chat and Profile Building . 
We used react native , node js , and my sql . 

Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime environment -- it's what actually executes all your server-side
code . Express is a framework that provides basic features for developing a web application in Node.js 
While Node.js is already capable of listening to requests on a port , Express makes it simpler to set up a web server 
eliminating boilerplate code and offering a simpler API for creating endpoints. 

GraphQL is a query language , GraphQL.js is the JavaScript implementation of GraphQL. Neither is capable of creating 
an endpoint or web server . GraphQL itself doesn't listen to requests being made to a particular sport . 

Node.js 
A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server . It's a low-level environment that 
provides essential modules for server-side JavaScript . 

Express.js 
A web application framework that's built on top of node.js . It provides higher-level abstractions for web
development , including features like routing , middleware and templating . 


Firebase
Firebase is Google's mobile application development platform that helps you build , improve and grow your application . 
Firebase is Google's mobile application development platform . (yes , that again)
You're gonna save a ton of time and money using Firebase products rather than trying to build them yourself . 
You can use all of it , or none of it . or just the bits you want. 
All those bits are designed to work well together , managed in one console .

Serverless architecture
Serverless architecture is a software design approach that allows developers to build and run applications without 
managing the underlying infrastructure . In a serverless architecture , the cloud service provider is responsible for 
managing adn scaling the cloud infrastructure that runs on the application code. 


Firestore 
Firestore is a cloud-hosted , NoSQL document database from Google that's part of Firebase. 
Firestore is a JSON-compatible database that stores data in documents , which are organized 
into collections . Each document contains a set of key-value pairs.  

Reading through the documentation helps how the software is documented.

Before you start coding , learn about the low level language . 

1. Code in a low level language .
i am pretty sure that many of you will be able to code in the language like python , 
javaScript or Ruby . 
So , take the concepts and code in low level language like C 
To not leak memory , to not give access to hackers , and to not crash when running , u need 
to code in C .

2 . Learn as Assembly varient . 
Learning the CPU is going to be a superpower .

3 . Learn reverse engineering

Challenging projects every programmer should try 

Before even starting to code , learn what are you intrested in .
